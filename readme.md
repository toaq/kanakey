# What is this?

This is an input method people can use to type Toaq text with correct diacritical marks. The basic paradigm is that this script runs constantly in the background, and when you want to type Toaq, you will:

    1. Type alt+; to activate the script.
    2. Type the Toaq text in the format "Mai4 ji2 suq2 da.".
    3. Type a bare ; to finish, and the script will erase the text you typed and replace it with pretty Toaq text.

# How do I run it?

Navigate to the top-level directory and type "make run".

# Why is it called kanakey?

Because I originally wrote this script to do a similar thing with Japanese text, and only later modified it to do Toaq text instead. You'll see traces of this if you look through the source code.
