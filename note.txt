Idea: use capital letters to signal katakana.

New system (?):

    1. JPN mode is activated and concluded with alt+;.
    2. JPN mode status is indicated in the Xfce status bar.
    3. In kana mode, lowercase is hirigana and uppercase is katakana.
    4. Use a pair of ; to delimit a kanji.
    5. In the printing phase, kanji ambiguities are resolved by asking
       for additional input.
    6. Translations of eg . to 。are made automatically, use \ to get
       literal characters.

    Unsure how to handle special characters like ￥.
